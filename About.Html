  <h2>What is tue difference between a Normal HTML and a Semantic HTML ?</h2>
  
  <ul>
   
   <li>
  
Normal HTML focuses primarily on defining the structure of a web page using generic elements like <div> and <span>. These elements are versatile and can be used for layout purposes or to group content, but they don't provide any inherent meaning or context to the content they contain. For example, a <div> element may be used to create a section of a web page without indicating what type of content it contains.
</li>
<h4>While</h4>

<li>
Semantic HTML: Semantic HTML, on the other hand, emphasizes the use of elements that carry meaning and convey the purpose of the content they represent. Semantic elements are specifically designed to describe the structure and semantics of the content, making it more accessible and understandable. 
Examples of semantic elements include header, nav, main, section, article, aside, footer, h1 to h6 for headings, p for paragraphs, ul and ol for lists, table for tabular data, and more.

<h2>Explain the disparity between closing tags and self-closing tags in HTML?</h2>
<article>
  <ul>
    
  
<li> Closing Tags: Closing tags are used for elements that contain content, such as text, images, or other elements, and require both an opening and closing tag. The opening tag consists of the element name enclosed in angle brackets (< and >), while the closing tag includes a forward slash (/) before the element name. 
  </li>
  
  <li>Self-Closing Tags: Self-closing tags are used for elements that do not contain any content and are self-contained. They are represented by a single tag that includes a forward slash before the closing angle bracket. Self-closing tags indicate that the element is complete and does not require separate opening and closing tags.
  </li>
  <li> In summary, closing tags are used for elements with content that require both an opening and a closing tag, while self-closing tags are used for elements that do not have content and can be represented by a single tag.
  </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>What distinguishes inline elements from block elements in HTML ?</h2>
  
  <h3>Inline Elements:</h3>
  <ol>
   <li> Inline Elements doesn't start on a new line and only take up as much with as necessary to display content.</li>
   <li>They allow other online elements to appear next to them horizontally within the same Line</li>
   
   <li>Inline elements cannot have padding,margin or set width and Heights applied to them directly. Any style applied to inline elements typically affects their content rather than their layout.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Block Elements:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Block elements start on a new line and occupy the full width available to them, extending to the left and right edges of their containing element.</li>
    <li>They create a visual "block" or rectangular area on the page and typically contain other block or inline elements.</li>
    <li>Block elements can have margins, paddings, widths, and heights applied to them, affecting their layout and positioning within the document.</li>
